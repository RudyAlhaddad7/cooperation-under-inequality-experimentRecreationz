## üéØ Project Overview

This project explores two classic public goods game settings:

- **Threshold Public Goods Game (ThresholdPGG):**  
  Players contribute to a public good. The public good is provided only if total contributions reach a minimum threshold.

- **Linear Public Goods Game (LinearPGG):**  
  Players contribute to a public good, producing returns linearly proportional to total contributions.

The experiments investigate how player heterogeneity‚Äîdifferences in endowment, productivity, or group alignment‚Äîaffects cooperation, contribution behavior, and strategies over repeated game rounds.

## üîç Objectives

- Replicate and explore treatment effects (equality, endowment inequality, productivity inequality, aligned/misaligned inequality).
- Visualize contribution dynamics across sessions and rounds.
- Compare Threshold vs Linear public goods games.
- Analyze player behavior relative to stated preferences (from questionnaires).
- Demonstrate Python and Excel skills in a research context.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Methods & Tools

- **Python:**  
  `pandas`, `matplotlib`/`seaborn`, `statsmodels`  
  (for data cleaning, visualization, regression analysis)
- **Excel:**  
  (for summary statistics, pivot tables, contribution trend charts)
